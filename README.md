## Description
This project is my first website created. It is advertising an app that you can download. The app allows you to specify the type of waves you prefer, whether it's gentle swells for a relaxed ride, medium waves for a bit more excitement, or powerful breaks for the ultimate thrill. Additionally, you can choose the type of surfboard that suits your style, from longboards for cruising to shortboards for agile maneuvers. By customizing these preferences, SurfAdventure ensures you get matched with the best locations and equipment tailored to your surfing style. Dive into a seamless and personalized surfing experience, where every detail is designed to enhance your ride and elevate your adventure.
